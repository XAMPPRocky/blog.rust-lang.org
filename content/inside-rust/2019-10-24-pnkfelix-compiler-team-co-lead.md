I'm happy to announce that [pnkfelix] will be joining me as compiler
team co-lead. Felix was a "founding member" of the compiler team when
it first started, and was involved with Rust long before that. For the
last year or so, he's been taking over an increasingly large share of
"compiler team leadership", including running the weekly triage
meeting and generally tending to the quality of the compiler as a
whole. So many thanks to [pnkfelix] for all that he does, and
congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
